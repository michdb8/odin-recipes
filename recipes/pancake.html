    <h1>Pancakes</h1>

    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card,
        this was a family favorite.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add
                milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to
                3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
