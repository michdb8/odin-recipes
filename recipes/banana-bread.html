    <H1> Banana Bread</H1>
    <img src="../img/Banana-Bread.jpg" alt="banana bread" width="500" height="500">
    <p>This banana bread has been the most popular recipe on Simply Recipes for over 10 years. Thousands of people make
        it every day.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into
                the mashed bananas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the
                center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the
                loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until
                the loaf is fully baked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and
                let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't
                crumbly.) Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage,
                refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
